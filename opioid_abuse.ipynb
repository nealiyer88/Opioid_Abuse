    "# Predicting Opioid Abuse: Survey Efficacy Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1: Business Understanding\n",
    "In the face of the ongoing opioid crisis, it's essential to identify individuals at risk of opioid abuse as early as possible. This project is designed to support stakeholders, such as healthcare providers, addiction counselors, and policymakers, by evaluating two different surveys to see which one better predicts opioid misuse. By finding the most reliable survey, we aim to empower these stakeholders with insights that help in early intervention and targeted support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1: Objective\n",
    "We have data from two distinct surveys, each containing information that may indicate potential risk factors for opioid abuse. However, itâ€™s unclear which survey provides a stronger basis for accurate prediction. Our goal is to determine which dataset better identifies individuals at risk of opioid misuse, ultimately guiding our stakeholders toward the most effective tool for their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2: Method\n",
    "To achieve this, we will employ a **machine learning classification model**. This model will analyze various factors within each survey dataset and classify individuals as either \"at-risk\" or \"not at risk\" for opioid abuse. By comparing the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made from each survey, we can identify which survey holds greater predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will not only give a clear comparison but also offer data-driven insights into how each survey can serve the community in the fight against opioid abuse.\n"
